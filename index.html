            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a researcher with 3 years of experience and over 4
                years of industry-level coding experience. Through experience
                with Vaisala and the Atmospheric Electricity Research Team at
                the University of Maryland (UMD), I have gained a wealth of
                experience
                working with large lightning data and streamlining efficient
                algorithms. I gave an oral presentation on machine
                learning-related lightning research at 2023 AMS and was awarded
                an honorable mention across all graduate and undergraduate
                students for my presentation. I conduct research for the UMD
                Space Power and Propulsion Lab where I code MATLAB simulations
                pertaining to plasma-material interactions under Dr. Jarred
                Young. I am part of the Fan Module and Boundary Layer subteams
                on a Fluids Mechanics Education project led by Dr. Kenneth
                Kiger. As the UMD XPrize iniative to prevent forest fires ramps
                up, I am part of the detector design team. I am currently
                pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
                Maryland with an undergraduate GPA of 3.98 and a major GPA of
                4.00.
